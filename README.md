# README

This repo is my working directory for most research work I'd ever done during my PhD.

It contains codes for the following papers:

- Zhang, X., He, S., Liu, K., & Zhao, J. (2024, April). Unsupervised Learning of Neural Semantic Mappings with the Hungarian Algorithm for Compositional Semantics. In ICASSP 2024-2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) (pp. 9971-9975). IEEE.
- Zhang, X., He, S., Liu, K., & Zhao, J. (2023, December). On the Effects of Structural Modeling for Neural Semantic Parsing. In Proceedings of the 27th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) (pp. 38-57).

Meanwhile, it also contains
- codes for other works not published successfully
- several utilites for CFG parsing and some daily but simple tasks
- some common neural network modules
- and the grammar definitions I'd collected, such as SQL, EBNF, etc.

It also exhibits the usage of the TrialBot lib, which I'd made it a separate [repo](https://github.com/zxteloiv/trialbot) and obtainable from PyPI.
